# PHAC-Hello-World


The Task: The "challenge" would be deploying a "hello world" style web application (Python or Javascript/Node.js would be pretty relevant) in Google's Cloud Run service, with bonus points for creating a GitHub account and saving the code in a public repository. In general, getting code from GitHub containerised and deployed on either Cloud Run or GKE Autopilot is going to be a pretty big part of what we do, and need to help others do

1. Use Javascript/Node.js to create a "Hello World" web application
2. Get it to run automatically in Google Cloud Run Service
3. Bonus: create a github account and add it!
