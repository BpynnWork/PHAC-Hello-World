# PHAC-Hello-World

As mentioned we're intending to lean heavily into automation and specifically deployment pipelines and containers; something that would be pretty different from what you've done before. The "challenge" would be deploying a "hello world" style web application (Python or Javascript/Node.js would be pretty relevant) in Google's Cloud Run service, with bonus points for creating a GitHub account and saving the code in a public repository. In general, getting code from GitHub containerised and deployed on either Cloud Run or GKE Autopilot is going to be a pretty big part of what we do, and need to help others do. This is aimed at giving you a taste of that and getting you to create a GitHub account, which you'll need.
